# rate_partitions.py
Written by: T Malm and C Pe√±a - 20180517

Script to read a TIGER rate file (or other rate files) and produce partitions
from the rates usable for analyses.

Currently partition sizes are calculated as follows:
The first partition is calculated as:

``````
highest_rate - ((highest_rate - minimum_rate)/(divfactor)), the remaining bins as:
higher_rate - ((higher_rate - lower_rate)/divfactor + partition_number * 0.3)
``````

leading to smaller bin rate spans with faster rates (=lower rates), the last
partition will be created when 10% or less characters are left.

Run the script from terminal with a rate-file, as first argument, and the wanted
divfactor, as second argument, and it will produce a new output file with
partition rate summaries and partition schemes for MrBayes and PHYLIP.

The rate file should be a file with rates separated by hard return (TIGER rate
output -rl command) and in order of the character alignment you want to use later.

Run as: `python rate_partitions.py X Y` where X is the input rate file and Y
is the division factor (e.g. 1.35)

The output file will be named after the input values: `inputfilename_divfactor.txt`
